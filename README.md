## Introduction

The average house prices within an area can serve as an indicator of its socioeconomic status, shedding light on potential deprivation. Research findings suggest a gradual decline in house prices corresponding to increasing levels of deprivation <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>. Deprivation, synonymous with inequalities, encompasses various dimensions <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>, one of which is the digital divide. This phenomenon highlights the lack of reliable internet access in deprived areas <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>.

In this essay, we delve into an examination of the potential correlation between the average internet download speed of Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) in England and Wales and the average house prices in the year 2018.
